# Acoustic Anomaly Detection under changes in environmental noise 
How can potential faults in machinery be diagnosed without expert human intervention?
Using microphones as a sensor for this task would allow non-destructive sensing and early detection of faults in a machine.
Machine learning models that are trained on normal machinery sounds, which is an unsupervised approach, is most practical. 
In a real life application only small amounts of normal could be gathered to train a model. 
Exisiting datasets avaliable for this task include:
- MIMII (Malfunctioning Industrial Machinery Investigation and Inspection)[1]
- MIMII 2
- ToyAdmos
- ToyAdmos 2 [4]

In this thesis, experiments around the effects of environmental noise on these models are tested.
